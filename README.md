## Description
### Problem
The DA’s office process a ton of data via physical forms. Inaccurate reporting or missing data has the potential to change the outcome of a court ruling, or whether or not the DA’s office decides to prosecute a particular case. It is absolutely vital for them to receive data accurately and efficiently.

### Our Solution
In this project our team created an iOS app for the DA's Office, so that they can quickly scan physical documents and have them digitized and uploaded to a database where the data is easily searchable and secure.

When a user opens the app the can choose to register or login if they already have an account. From there they will be brought to the documents page where they can select which document they are uploading and then upload a document via their camera role or by taking a picture using the phone's camera.

This project has the potential to serve as a proof of concept for the Suffolk county DA’s office so that they can develop a more streamlined process that can be shared with DA Offices around the country
